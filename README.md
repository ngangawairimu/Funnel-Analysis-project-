### Overview
This project performs a funnel analysis on user engagement data from the tc-da-1.turing_data_analytics dataset. The primary goal is to visualize and understand the user journey across various interaction stages, including:

- page_view
- view_item
- add_to_cart
- begin_checkout
- add_shipping_info
- add_payment_info
- purchase
By identifying drop-off points between these stages, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights to improve user retention, enhance the user experience, and boost conversion rates.

### Methodology
- Focus on Key Stages:

The funnel is analyzed to track user progression through the critical stages listed above.
Event counts and conversion rates are calculated at each step.
 ## Country Segmentation:

The top three countries with the highest event counts are identified for deeper analysis.
Data is enriched with country-specific insights using a mapping process.
## Visualization:

Funnel progression and drop-off rates are visualized to highlight key trends and potential bottlenecks.
Insights and Applications
## Key Observations:

- Critical drop-off points, such as from add_to_cart to begin_checkout, are identified.
